                    Our goal is to provide people of all ages with the ability to find a list of recipes for already existing dishes. The application will take user input of ingredients that the user currently possesses and give you a recipe based on what the user is seeking. The parameters include selecting the length of preparation, the number of calories in the meal, and whether or not that meal is considered health conscious.
